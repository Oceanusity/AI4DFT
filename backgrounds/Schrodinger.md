For the classic physics, object is treated as particle. It exists in a centain position $x$ with momentum $p = mv$.

Conceptually, wave is combined with magitude and phase denoting as $Ae^{i\theta}$, where $A$ is the mangitude and $\theta$ is the phase.
With the periodical property of wave, the phase is changed cyclicaly with the time showing as $\theta = \omega t$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

As shown in the figure imported from [Wiki](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Out_of_phase_AE.gif), the phase $\theta$ changes periodically with time $t$ with a fix frequency $f$. 

As waves propagate through space, the phase varies with distance from the sound source with $\Delta \theta = \frac{2 \pi \bar{r}}{\lambda} = \mathbf{k} \mathbf{r}$, where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector from the sound source, $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\mathbf{k} = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \mathbf{r}$ is the wavevector.

In conclusion, the waves can be denoted as $f(\mathbf{r}, t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$ to consider the space and time dimension.

Then, it is observed that light has wave–particle duality. That's to say, light can also be denoted as $f(\mathbf{r}, t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$, which is one kind of electromagnetic waves.

Furthermore, with the concept of matter waves proposed by DeBroglie, particles can also be represented as waves with wavelength $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant, and $p$ is the momentum. 
For the situation of standing wave which is time-independent, when the momentum of a particle is determined, the corresponding wavelength is established, enabling the representation wavefunction.
