For the classic physics, object is treated as particle. It exists in a centain position $x$ with momentum $p = mv$.

As we already known, sound can be represented as wave denoted as 
$f(\mathbf{r}, t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$, where $A$ is the mangitude, and $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector from the sound source, $\mathbf{k} = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \mathbf{r}$ is the wavevector with $\mathbf{k}\mathbf{r} =  \frac{2\pi \bar{r}}{\lambda}$ , $\omega = 2 \pi f$ is the angular frequency. 

Conceptually, wave is combined with magitude and phase denoting as $Ae^{i\theta}$. 
With the periodical property of wave, the phase is changed cyclicaly with the time showing as $\theta = \omega t$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

As shown in the figure, the phase $\theta$ changes periodically with time $t$ with a fix frequency $f$.
